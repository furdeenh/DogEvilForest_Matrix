//	 This method prints out the board such that it looks like a board.  It
//	 prints a blank space for any square (for squares that do not have
//	 food, traps, walls, the dog, and aren't the beginning or the ending.
//   (at first, there will be no food or traps, or even walls or dog, but we
//   will be adding food as 'F' character, traps as 'T' character, walls as
//   '|' or '_' characters, and the dog 'D' character to the board, so you want
//   to print a space for everything that isn't a 'T','F','|','_',or'D'.
//	 Otherwise it prints out the character in the square. Note that I printed a
//	 border around the entire board so it was easier to look at, and, equally,
//	 I placed an -> arro (thats a minus and a greater than sign) in the border
//	 for where the beginning of the game was and where the end of the game was.

	//Instructions for writing boardConfig:
	/* this method and the moveDog method are probably the longest methods.
	 * This method first puts dummy values in every square (I used '+' - I just didn't want
	 * every square to have gibberish, so I chose a character I wasn't using for any other
	 * purpose and initialized every square to have that value).
	 * I then added my random horizontal and vertical walls.
	 *
	 * Here's how I did it the walls:
	 *
	 * I only placed walls in the odd numbered rows and columns (in other words, row one might
	 * have a row, but then row 2 would not, whereas row three could and row 4 could not.
	 * Same with columns (although you can have flexibility.
	 *
	 * I picked an odd row or column that did not already have a wall in it at all.
	 *
	 * I generated a total of 10 walls.

	 * For each wall, I picked randomly for vertical or horizontal (just rand() % 2 to get either
	 * 0 for vertical, 1 for horizontal.
	 *
	 * I set the easy version to have at most 9 squares in a row or column as a wall, the
	 * medium to have at most 13 squares as walls in a row or column, and the hard version to
	 * have at most 16 squares per row or column.(but you can play with this because sometimes
	 * the hard version was seriously hard!!!
	 *
	 * Let's say I randomly decided to place a wall in row 3.  I then randomly chose 9 squares in
	 * row 3 to be a wall (if it was the easy version, 13 if it was the medium, and 16 if it was
	 * the hard)
	 *
	 * So that's the walls.  Then I added the 'D' to the beginning square nad an 'E' to the end square.

	 * First, it determines the new coordinats of the dog, based on teh direction in which the
	 * dog wants to move (based on what c holds - u is up, d is down, l is left, r is right).
	 *
	 * If the dog is at teh edge of the board, teh dog should not move
	 *
	 * If the dog moves over food, a random number between 2 and 17 is generated, and the
	 * dog's changeStrength method is used to increase the dog's strength by the random amount.
	 *
	 * If the dog moves over the end of the board, the dog's won method is called and false is
	 * returned from this method.
	 *
	 * If the dog moves over a Trap, a random number between 2 and 17 is generated and the dog's
	 * changeStrength method is called with that negative number.  (Note that the changeStrength
	 * method returns a boolean indicating whether the dog's strength has gone to 0 or less, and
	 * thus the dog has died and the game is over. That boolean value is returned from this method).
	 *
	 * If the dog moves over a wall, the method checks to see if the dog has enough strength to
	 * knock down the wall (I made it cost 6 strength points to knock down a wall).  If the dog
	 * has enough strength, the user is asked, "Do you want to knock down that wall?"  If the user
	 * responds "yes", then the wall is knocked down, the dog moves into that square, adn the dog's
	 * strength decreases by 6.  If the answer is "no", the dog loses 1 strength point, just because.
	 *
	 * If the dog moves into a blank square, the dog loses 2 strength points using the changeStrength
	 * method (which, again, will return false if the dog has lost all their strength and died.
	 *
	 * NOTE: I am not concerned with the precise rules here.  If you want to change the range of
	 * random numbers for food, if you are worried about whether you still lose 2 strength points for
	 * moving even though you gained points for moving over food - I'm leaving all that to your preference.
	 * I am concerned that you are using classes, objects, and object methods and accessing object
	 * fields correctly!
